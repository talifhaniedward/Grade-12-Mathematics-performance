# Power BI Report: Grade 12 Mathematics Performance

## Data Preparation

Before creating the report, I performed **data profiling** to examine the data structure, content, quality, and relationships. I checked for completeness, duplicates, and consistency in the dataset.

Next, I applied the **ETL process**:

- **Extract:** Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI.  
- **Transform:** Used Power Query to clean the data, check data types, and remove duplicates.  
- **Load:** Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI for analysis.
